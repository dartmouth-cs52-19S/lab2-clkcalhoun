## Which Top Gear presenter are you? Buzzfeed Quiz

As a Top Gear fan, I know the ins and outs of the three presenters. I created this quiz so that people can figure out which they are most like! It came out fairly well. Given more time, I would improve the styling, make more questions, improve the images in the answers, make the results funnier, and add more complex weighting to the result computation.

##Things to note

* I picked the CSS option and did not have time for extra credit stuff.
* Almost everything is aniamated or changes as you hover or click.
* The javascript could definitely be better. My last minute hack to get non-selected answers to fade was very hacky. I should have figured out a way to do this in a few lines of code. 
* The mobile version works but is sub-ideal. I would improve this if I had more time.

## References

* Many pages were referenced in the creation of this quiz. I did not copy code as far as I can remember, I just refered to tutorials and information as I worked. If there is something I should have referenced but forgot I used, please let me know and I can dig it up.
